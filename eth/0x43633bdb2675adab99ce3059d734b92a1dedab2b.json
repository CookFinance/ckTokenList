    "en": "ETH DeFi Index (EDI) includes the DeFi projects that have the largest circulating market capitalizations on Ethereum blockchain.\nObjective\nThe ETH DeFi Index (EDI) is an index designed to track the performance of the top DeFi projects. The index is weighted based on the value of each token’s circulating supply. \nMethodology\nThe Cook Protocol team has used the following criteria to select what tokens will be included in the ETH DeFi Index (EDI):\nThe tokens are available on Ethereum mainnet\nThe token must not be considered a security by the corresponding authorities across different jurisdictions.\nThe selected tokens must have sufficient liquidity across a variety of trading platforms.\nThe tokens must be ranked as top 50 tokens with the largest market cap on Coingecko and CoinMarketCap consistently\nThe tokens must have gone through audits and must comply with security best practices\nThe circulating market capitalizations of each project are used to calculate index composition. \nInitial Allocation Breakdown:\nETH \nUNI \nLINK \nMATIC \nAAVE \nMAKER\n circulating_supply is the number of tokens circulating in the market. CoinGecko is used as a reference source \nmarket_price is the market price of the token in USD. CoinGecko is used as a reference source \nindex_divisor is a constant used to compute the nominal value of the index. The divisor is XXX at inception \nindex_price is the spot value of the index token \nAny token that has a weight greater than 25% has its weight capped at 25% \nOperation \nThe ETH DeFi Index (EDI) is a tokenized representation of the top DeFi projects on Ethereum. \nAt the third week of the third month, the ETH DeFi Index (EDI) will be evaluated and tokens might be added and deleted from the index. As a result, the circulating supply of each component token will be recalculated based on the data from CoinGecko after updates on the index composition. The index components are adjusted, added, deleted or unchanged. New index weights, additions and deletions are incorporated into the index during the monthly reconstitution, which will take place on the first business day of the month." ,
