    "en": "Cook Largecap Index (CLI) includes five tokens that have the largest circulating market capitalizations. These large cap tokens represent the biggest and the best tokens in crypto and are the cornerstones of the entire industry.\nObjective\nThe Cook Largecap Index (CLI) is a digital asset index designed to track five of the largest tokens’ performance in the crypto industry. The index is weighted based on the value of each token’s circulating supply.\nMethodology\nThe Cook Protocol team has used the following criteria to select what tokens will be included in the Cook Largecap Index (CLI):\nThe tokens must be available on Ethereum mainnet\nThe token must not be considered a security by the corresponding authorities across different jurisdictions.\nThe selected tokens must have sufficient liquidity across a variety of trading platforms.\nThe tokens must be ranked as top 100 tokens with the largest market cap on Coingecko and CoinMarketCap consistently\nThe tokens must have gone through audits and must comply with security best practices\nThe circulating market capitalizations of each project are used to calculate index composition. \nInitial Allocation Breakdown:\nBitcoin\nEthereum\ncirculating_supply is the number of tokens circulating in the market. CoinGecko is used as a reference source\nmarket_price is the market price of the token in USD. CoinGecko is used as a reference source\nindex_divisor is a constant used to compute the nominal value of the index. The divisor is XXX at inception\nindex_price is the spot value of the index token\nOperation\nThe Cook Largecap Index (CLI) is a tokenized representation of the five largest projects in crypto. At the third week of the third month every quarter, the largecap index will be evaluated and tokens might be added and deleted from the index. As a result, the circulating supply of each component token will be recalculated based on the data from CoinGecko after updates on the index composition. The index components are adjusted, added, deleted or unchanged. New index weights, additions and deletions are incorporated into the index during the monthly reconstitution, which will take place on the first business day of the month.",
